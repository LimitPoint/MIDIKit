# MIDIKitUI Example

This example shows usage of the MIDIKitUI SwiftUI controls.

> **Warning**: This project is still a work-in-progress and some features may be broken until a future update.

## To Do

- [ ] Add multiple-selection list controls
- [ ] Demonstrate updating connections in the `MIDIManager` on endpoint selection change
- [ ] Add `unownedOnly: Bool` parameter to controls so they can filter out manager-owned virtual endpoints (♻️)
