# MTC Video Player Example (SwiftUI macOS/iOS)

This example demonstrates receiving MTC and synchronizing a video player.

## Key Features

- Embedded video player syncs to incoming MTC (MIDI Timecode)

## Troubleshooting

- ⚠️ If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
- ⚠️ When building for a physical iOS device or "Designed for iPad", you must select your Team ID in the app target's code signing.
